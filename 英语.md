联系与区别：

Even if and even though are both conjunctions used to introduce a contrasting or unexpected situation. However, there is a slight difference in their usage. "Even if" is used to express a hypothetical or unlikely condition, emphasizing that something will happen or be done regardless of the circumstances. For example, "Even if it rains, I will still go for a walk." On the other hand, "even though" is used to introduce a known fact or situation that contrasts with the following statement. It emphasizes that despite the given circumstances, something else is still true or happening. For instance, "Even though it was late, she stayed up to finish her work." In summary, "even if" focuses on a hypothetical condition, while "even though" emphasizes a known fact or situation.

有点类似while的用法，联系与区别：

Whereas and while are both conjunctions that are used to introduce contrasting or opposing ideas in a sentence. However, they are used in slightly different contexts. "Whereas" is typically used to introduce a contrasting clause or phrase that provides additional information or background context to the main clause. It is often used in legal or formal documents to present facts or reasons for a decision. On the other hand, "while" is used to introduce a contrasting clause that happens at the same time as the main clause. It is commonly used in everyday speech and writing to show a simultaneous action or situation. Overall, whereas is more formal and used for presenting contrasting information, while is more casual and used for showing simultaneous actions.
