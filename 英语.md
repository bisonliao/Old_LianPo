Even if and even though are both conjunctions used to introduce a contrasting or unexpected situation. However, there is a slight difference in their usage. "Even if" is used to express a hypothetical or unlikely condition, emphasizing that something will happen or be done regardless of the circumstances. For example, "Even if it rains, I will still go for a walk." On the other hand, "even though" is used to introduce a known fact or situation that contrasts with the following statement. It emphasizes that despite the given circumstances, something else is still true or happening. For instance, "Even though it was late, she stayed up to finish her work." In summary, "even if" focuses on a hypothetical condition, while "even though" emphasizes a known fact or situation.
