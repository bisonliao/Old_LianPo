The image on the left is a simple yet inspiring depiction of small parks within communities. Residents enjoy spending time in these nearby parks, engaging in activities such as running, flying kites, and practicing yoga. The chart on the right illustrates the steady growth of small community parks in Guangzhou over the past three years, with the number increasing from 406 in 2020 to 532 in 2021, and 670 in 2022.

Small community parks are essential for the well-being of citizens and serve as a symbol of urban civilization. People need not only food, clothing, and shelter, but also leisure time and spiritual enrichment. After a day’s work, citizens can stroll through these parks with their families, enjoying the soothing sounds of birds and the gentle breeze.

In modern society, people often spend long hours working and studying, which can be exhausting. Small community parks provide an opportunity for quick physical exercise, helping individuals to recharge and boost their creativity. The government is actively working to build more parks, improving the quality of life for its citizens. This initiative is crucial for the health and productivity of society as a whole.

一个外国朋友email我寻求帮我，他需要完成一个课后作业，关于中国古代科学家的ppt课堂呈现。下面是AI帮我润色后的email：

Dear Paul,

I’m truly glad to receive your email. Your class assignment sounds fascinating and inspires me a lot. I hope I can offer some helpful advice.

Ancient China has a rich history spanning over 5,000 years, with many great scientists contributing to various fields, including mathematics, medicine, agriculture, architecture, and more. For your presentation, it might be a good idea to start with a brief overview of Chinese scientific achievements.

Then, you could focus on one or two specific fields to delve into more detail. For example, Chinese medicine is a vast field with its own system of knowledge and many renowned scientists such as Bian Que, Li Shizhen, and Hua Tuo. Each of these figures made significant contributions and has fascinating stories associated with their work.

You can find a wealth of information online, but compared to traditional search engines, AI tools like ChatGPT can be more convenient. You can ask specific questions, and the AI will respond as if it’s a knowledgeable friend in the field you’re researching.

Thank you for reaching out, and please feel free to contact me again if you have any further questions.

Best regards,
Li Ming

**Dear Jack,**

I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out to share my proposed plan for our upcoming survey on the preservation of old houses in Fenghuang, a historic town in Hunan Province.

I suggest we begin our trip this Friday, which would give us the opportunity to meet with local residents in the old houses on Saturday, when they are likely to be free from work. Spending the weekend interacting with the community will allow us to collect valuable first-hand insights. On Monday, we can then visit the local cultural heritage department to gather more detailed information from the officials involved in the preservation efforts.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this plan. Please feel free to share any suggestions or feedback you might have.

The bar chart illustrates the key benefits gained by students who participated in a social practice course at a university. Nearly 1,000 students took part in the survey, and the results highlight four main areas of improvement. Among the participants, 84.8% reported that the course enhanced their practical skills, 91.3% gained substantial knowledge related to the subject, 32.6% noted an improvement in their collaboration skills, and 54.4% expressed that they enjoyed the experience.

Social practice and hands-on labor offer valuable, real-world insights into both nature and society, which is particularly important for university students. By engaging in these activities, students are able to see how the theoretical knowledge learned in the classroom can be applied in practical settings. This helps deepen their understanding of the subject matter and connects academic learning with real-life applications.

Based on information from a friend of mine who works in the relevant field, the art exhibition features a famous French painter who is truly talented and an emerging star in his domain. On the other hand, the robot exhibition mainly features second-tier manufacturers and is more of a sales event than a showcase of groundbreaking technology.

Given that you are a university student majoring in the history of Western art, I believe the art exhibition would be more valuable to you, even though I know you are also very interested in technology.

Residents **have grown** **accustomed** to receiving **numerous** packages from **various** e-commerce platforms, such as JD, Taobao (TB), and Pinduoduo (PDD).

要求就一张关于两父子对话的图片写一篇议论文。下面是AI润色后的文章

**Subject: Follow Your Heart**

This picture is particularly **thought-provoking** as it highlights an important life lesson about **staying true to oneself.**

In the picture, a boy and his father are having an inspiring conversation. The boy **laments**, "Dad, many of my classmates think it’s outdated and old-fashioned to learn Peking Opera. I feel ashamed." The father **wisely** responds, "But you love Peking Opera, right? It’s wonderful as long as you’re **passionate about** it. Just ignore others’ opinions."

**This exchange offers us much to reflect on.** **Too often**, we focus **excessively** on making the “right” choices according to societal standards, feeling **insecure or uncertain** when others disagree **with** or disapprove **of** our **decisions**. However, **blindly** following others **rather than** **our true passions** is rarely the right path. The key is to follow our hearts and have the courage to be ourselves.

Life is short, and we only get one chance to **live authentically**. **Embracing our uniqueness** and **pursuing what we truly love** allows us to live with meaning and **fulfillment**. So, be brave, be different, and most importantly, be yourself.

补充：

**Instead of and rather than** are both used to indicate a preference or choice between two options. However, instead of is more commonly used in everyday language and is considered more informal, while rather than is often used in more formal or academic writing. Additionally, instead of is typically used to suggest an alternative action or choice, while rather than is used to emphasize a preference or contrast between two options.

There is a Chinese saying: *"Wise men enjoy mountains, while kind men love waters."* As someone both wise and kind, I believe you will appreciate the serene beauty of our mountains as well.

**Subject:** "Having Books" vs. "Reading Books"

This picture is particularly thought-provoking as it vividly **contrasts** two different attitudes toward learning.

On the left side of the illustration, a "clever" boy reclines comfortably in an armchair, surrounded by a shelf filled with hundreds of books. To him, owning books **equates** to acquiring knowledge. In stark contrast, a diligent young man is shown engrossed in reading the eighth book on his plan to complete 20 books this year. His perseverance **exemplifies** a disciplined approach to learning.

This scenario **mirrors** a common phenomenon in real life: many people struggle to persist in challenging tasks, such as reading. They enthusiastically make ambitious resolutions at the beginning of each year but often fail to **follow through**. Tasks planned for today are frequently postponed to tomorrow, and they convince themselves that buying books alone brings wisdom and accomplishment.

However, success in life and work hinges on **self-discipline and consistent effort**. It requires setting clear goals, creating detailed plans, and, most importantly, **adhering** to them. As the saying goes, "Action speaks louder than words." Only through diligent practice can we transform potential knowledge into true understanding and achievement.

Let us embrace the spirit of the diligent reader and make consistent efforts toward self-improvement.
